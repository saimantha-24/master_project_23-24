# master_project_23-24
Apps to plot and analyse multiples strain sweep, flow curves and particle size distribution curve. Each has customisation capabilities to adjust the font size and font of plot axes, markers and marker colors for each plot as well as labels for each plot. The user can also adjust the range of the x-axis. 

## Strain sweep app
The strain sweep program allows you to plot storage moduli against strain level, stress agains strain, storage moduli against strain and storage as well as loss moduli against strain. The app also allows user to obtain the yield strain from the plots through a variety of methods:
1. Stress vs strain plot - yield strain obtained from the point of inflection
2. Storage moduli vs strain - yield strain obtained by drawing two straight lines tangent to the plot and getting the yield strain as the point of intersection
3. Storage moduli and loss moduli vs strain - yield strain obtain from the point of intersection of the two lines

## Flow curves 
The flow curve program plots multiple viscosity against shear rate flow curves for multiple samples.  

## Laser diffraction 
The laser diffraction app allows the user to plot multiple particle size distribution curves.
